# RepoMeta
For lab6-1 I try to get the file HelloWorld.java from github and change its output then push it to RepoMeta
For lab6-2 I try to checkout the RepoMeta using svn co and create a HelloWorld3.java and add it to RepoMeta, then I change the output of HelloWorld3.java and create a new file call Hello.java and add it aswell. At the end I update them to RepoMeta.
Both logs were create in my desktop so I just upload both logs.
